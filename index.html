    <h1>🥐 Croissant - History of famous bread</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian
      origin,[1] but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for
      their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of
      a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled
      and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in
      a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry.
